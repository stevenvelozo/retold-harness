# REST Endpoints

Every entity in the model gets a complete set of CRUD endpoints, auto-generated by [Meadow Endpoints](https://github.com/stevenvelozo/meadow-endpoints).

## URL Patterns

For an entity named `Book`:

| Operation | Method | URL Pattern |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Create | POST | `/1.0/Book` |
| Read | GET | `/1.0/Book/:IDBook` |
| Reads | GET | `/1.0/Books` |
| Reads (paginated) | GET | `/1.0/Books/:Begin/:Cap` |
| Reads (filtered) | GET | `/1.0/Books/FilteredTo/:Filter` |
| Reads (filtered + paginated) | GET | `/1.0/Books/FilteredTo/:Filter/:Begin/:Cap` |
| Update | PUT | `/1.0/Book` |
| Delete | DELETE | `/1.0/Book/:IDBook` |
| Count | GET | `/1.0/Books/Count` |
| Count (filtered) | GET | `/1.0/Books/Count/FilteredTo/:Filter` |
| Schema | GET | `/1.0/Book/Schema` |
| New | GET | `/1.0/Book/Schema/New` |

> **Note:** Single-record operations use the singular form (`Book`), while multi-record operations use the plural form (`Books`).

## All Entity Endpoints

The harness generates endpoints for all 8 entities:

| Entity | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| User | `/1.0/User` | `/1.0/Users` |
| Book | `/1.0/Book` | `/1.0/Books` |
| Author | `/1.0/Author` | `/1.0/Authors` |
| BookAuthorJoin | `/1.0/BookAuthorJoin` | `/1.0/BookAuthorJoins` |
| BookPrice | `/1.0/BookPrice` | `/1.0/BookPrices` |
| BookStore | `/1.0/BookStore` | `/1.0/BookStores` |
| BookStoreInventory | `/1.0/BookStoreInventory` | `/1.0/BookStoreInventorys` |
| Review | `/1.0/Review` | `/1.0/Reviews` |
